Last year PhD student in Computer Science at Université Paris Saclay, advised by [Patrick Paroubek](https://perso.limsi.fr/pap/) and [Thierry Hamon](https://perso.limsi.fr/hamon/). I am working at [LISN Lab (CNRS)](https://www.lisn.fr/). 

My PhD subject is to assess data quality in the medical domain using natural language processing systems. I have been working on information extraction in clinical trials articles to assess the quality of the outcome reporting, as well as data selection for pretraining language models for the biomedical domain.
